This is heart disease prediction project In this project we are going to predict based on the data wether someone have the heart disease or not

1-Problem Defination

Based on the given data we need to predict if a patient has heart disease or not
Inatial Stages
What problem I am going to solve
What kind of data I have
Does this data have missing values
Are there any outliers, sporious vectors
Can we add or remove some of the features
2-Data

we have the data and load it
3-Evalute

In initial stages we need to make sure,if our model gives us the accuracy of 95%
4-Features

What features are import what features columns means what
age: age in years

sex:

sex: (1: male; 0: female)

cp: chest pain type (0: typical angina 1: atypical angina 2: non-anginal pain 3: asymptomatic)

trestbps: resting blood pressure

chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1: true; 0: false)

restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (0: normal 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)

thalach: maximum heart rate achieved

exang: exercise induced angina (1: yes; 0: no)

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest# Cardio-Project

5-Modelling The Model we are going to use * k-Nearest Neighbours Classifier * Random Forest Classifier * Logistic Regression# Data-Science
