# Heart Disease Prediction 
In this project we are going to predict based on the data wether someone have the heart disease or not.

You can use my Trained model using  (Heart_Disease_predictor.pkl)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform EDA to define problem and anlayze data.

#### Inatial Stages:
  * What problem I am going to solve
  * What kind of data I have
  * Does this data have missing values
  * Are there any outliers, sporious vectors
  * Can we add or remove some of the features
# Model Building 
The Model I have used.
   * k-Nearest Neighbours Classifier
   * Random Forest Classifier
   * Logistic Regression
# Evalute
Evaluated The model using 
   * Cross Validation Score
   * Accuracy Score
   * Precision
   * recall
   * f1 score
   * Classification Report
   * Confusion Metrix
   * Area Under The Curve
     
It Scored 84.2 accuracy
# Save Model
Save the model and load it to make prediction.
You just have to provide an csv file of your data and the model will perform predictions and tell you probability of disease, It will also give you recomendations based on prediction. It will also show you risk factors
